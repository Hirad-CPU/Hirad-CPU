Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Hirad's GitHub profile!

I'm Hirad, a passionate programmer and curious explorer with a love for software development, physics, and the mysteries of the universe. Fascinated by space exploration, astronomy, and the endless possibilities of the cosmos, Iâ€™m always eager to discover something new and push the boundaries of knowledge.

I also enjoy diving into the exciting worlds of electronics and robotics, combining creativity and engineering to bring innovative ideas to life. Skilled in C and Python, I use these powerful languages to turn my ideas into reality and solve complex problems.

Feel free to explore my repositories, share your thoughts, or collaborate on projects that aim for the stars! ðŸŒŒ
